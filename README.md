# Group movement 

The goal of this project is to implement group movement behaviors of two kinds: blended and priority based. Blended movement weighs different aspects of movement relevant for each agent and applies them in such a way that each agent will always try to keep its relative position in the group while still being flexible and adpt to the situation. Priority based movements ensure that some aspects take precedence over others so that certain movement targets are always met. 
In the video below you can see a hybrid approach which weighs the necessary adjustments to each agent's movement so that they follow their group's behavior while appearing fluid and natural in movement (blended movement) and uses stricter rules to ensure no agent allows itself to enter walls while following the group (priority movement).
